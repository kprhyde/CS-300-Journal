Project 1 and Project 2

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

In these projects, the problem was that I had to create a pseudocode and write the program to upload an Excel file of courses and allow a user to perform specific actions with its contents. The actions are to upload the file, sort the courses in alphanumerical order, search for a particular course by identifying a similar course ID, and exit the program.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I first attempted to solve the problem of what I thought was right. However, I soon realized I needed further research to understand how the file was read and how each part worked together to do the required tasks. This forced me to reevaluate what I thought to be true. Data structures are important because, depending on the type used and how it performs various functions, like searching and order control, can either improve or hinder efficiency. For example, a data structure for keeping reservations will not be as effective for holding thousands of different kinds of inventory. This is why researching what would be most effective for your purposes helps you choose the proper data structure for your program. 

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

Through constant research, determination, and trial and error, I learned many things about data structures, as these projects took me in many directions. I was also advised on how a single problem like this could be solved using multiple methods. In the future, I will work on building different data structures with an Excel file I create to become proficient in all versions. If anything, this course taught me that this is a weakness of mine, and I do not want to have weaknesses going into this field.  

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

Through all the research I did and the projects I worked on, I learned how lists can be used in various ways. How data within them can be altered, how specific parts of the data can be used to identify particular parts, parsing data, that you can have different data structures within data structures (1..n) to hold other types of data, and the list goes on. With the plethora of different ways that files are used, knowing which data structure will bring out the best option for efficiency in the business you work for is crucial. 

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

With the final project, I added many comments so anyone, or when I review it later, can understand what each function does and how the program operates. I tried to avoid hard-coding so that the list quantity could grow on its own. If the hash function had worked, it would have used a hard-coded table size of eight, but unfortunately, it stated the function was “ambiguous” and was left out of the final program. I have already tested adding another course to the course file, and it added it to the vector with no issues. Additionally, adding functions or tinkering with one of the original functions does not interfere with the whole program, so that maintenance can be done at different times.
